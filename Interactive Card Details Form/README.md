**This repository is intended for my solutions to Frontend Mentor platform challenges.**

## Hello, Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**Thank you for checking out this solution for this challenge!**  
Let's go over this project in a general way.

## About the Challenge ðŸŽ¯

The challenge is to build this page and make it as close as possible to the design.

Expected functionality:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real time
- Receive error messages when submitting the form if:
  - Any of the fields are empty
  - The card number, expiration date, or CVC are in the wrong format
- View the optimized layout depending on your deviceâ€™s screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page


## Layout ðŸŽ¨

All layouts (mobile and desktop) can be viewed in the `./design` folder of the application.

## Technologien and Concepts Used ðŸ’»

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Continuous Improvement ðŸš€

It was a very rewarding experience developing this website, especially the JavaScript side. I learned a lot by solving problems related to form error handling. This is my first form where thereâ€™s an interaction to update card details in real time based on the user's input. It was challenging, but it contributed a great deal to my learning process.

## Deployment ðŸ”¥

The application is hosted via GitHub Pages.
