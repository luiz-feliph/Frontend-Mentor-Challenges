## Hello, Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**Thanks for checking out this solution to this challenge!**  
Let's take a general look at this project.

The challenge is to build this page and make it as close as possible to the design.

Expected features:

## Continuous Improvement ðŸš€

This was my first challenge from Frontend Mentor. I was happy to be able to apply the knowledge Iâ€™ve been studying daily.

I completed this challenge calmly, without major difficulties. As it was the first challenge, it ended up being an introductory-level one, just to get familiar with the platform's features.
